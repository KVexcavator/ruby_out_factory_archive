In this example, the object connection is the receiver, download_mp3 is the name of the
method, the string "jitterbug" is the parameter, and the stuff between the braces is the associated
block. During this method call, Ruby first sets self to the receiver and then invokes
the method in that object: For class and module methods, the receiver will be the class or
module name.
If the splat is not the last lvalue, then Ruby ensures that the lvalues that follow it will all
receive values from rvalues at the end of the right side of the assignment—the splat lvalue
will soak up only enough rvalues to leave one for each of the remaining lvalues. (OK, that’s
a pretty tortuous explanation—some examples will help.)
